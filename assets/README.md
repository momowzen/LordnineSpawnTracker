assets/
This folder holds static assets used by the project (images, audio, sprites, etc).

Place project assets here and reference them from code. Keep the .gitkeep files so the directories are preserved in the repository when empty.

Recommended subfolders:
- images/ : PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.
- audio/  : WAV, MP3, OGG, etc.
- sprites/: sprite sheets and sprite metadata
